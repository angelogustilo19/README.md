## THE SHORT VERSION

I architect and deploy production AI systems on cloud infrastructure. Not demos. Not notebooks. **Real systems** with auth, persistence, orchestration, and users hitting them concurrently.

My sweet spot? Taking an idea from "wouldn't it be cool if..." to a containerized, Kubernetes-orchestrated reality running on GCP - often at zero infrastructure cost.

Data in. Business insights out. AI that doesn't just predict - it **drives decisions and revenue.**

### FEATURED PROJECT

</div>

### DEFENDER - AI-Powered Banking Fraud Prevention

> *From 3% to 93% detection rate. That's not a typo - that's a 32x improvement.*

![GCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/GCP-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecloud&logoColor=white)

A comprehensive deep learning platform that reframes fraud detection from binary classification to multi-class analysis - because fraudsters mimic normal transactions, but each fraud type leaves a unique signature.

<details>
<summary><b>SEE WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD</b></summary>

<br>

**THE PROBLEM:** Traditional binary fraud detection hit a ceiling at 2.9%. Fraudsters are too good at looking normal.

**THE BREAKTHROUGH:** Stop asking "is this fraud?" Start asking "what TYPE of fraud is this?" Multi-class classification exposes patterns that binary approaches miss completely.

**SCALE:**
- 40,000 banking transactions across 4 channels (ATM, POS, Digital, Branch)
- 11 distinct fraud patterns identified and modeled
- 68 deep learning models trained across 20 analysis categories
- Star schema data warehouse with 98 tables

**KEY ENGINEERING:**
- BiLSTM and GRU architectures for sequential pattern detection
- SHAP explainability for regulatory compliance and decision transparency
- Real-time risk scoring API with cost-benefit threshold optimization
- 9-page interactive Streamlit dashboard with Plotly visualizations
- Full production deployment on GCP Kubernetes - under $25/month

**RESULTS:**
- Binary classification baseline: 2.9% detection
- Multi-class BiLSTM: 93.3% average detection rate
- Best GRU model: 0.6036 AUC for cost-benefit optimization
- 86-100% detection per individual fraud type

**STACK:** PyTorch | FastAPI | Streamlit | MySQL | Kubernetes | GCP | SHAP | Plotly

<summary><b>SEE WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD</b></summary>

<br>

**THE PROBLEM:** Users need expert guidance on cloud architecture AND banking concepts - but most AI systems lack domain-specific depth.

**THE SOLUTION:** Intent detection that routes queries to specialized engines for cloud computing (GCP, Kubernetes, infrastructure) or banking expertise (financial analysis, loan calculations) with RAG enhancement.

**KEY ENGINEERING:**
- Multi-tier LLM fallback: Gemini 2.5 Flash → GPT-3.5 → Ollama (never fails silently)
- FAISS vector search for retrieval-augmented responses
- Per-user auth, chat history, and session persistence
- Command palette with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- Full CI/CD via GitHub Actions → Docker → K3s on GCP

**STACK:** FastAPI | React 18 | Material-UI | MySQL | Kubernetes | Traefik | GCP

### CLOUD-NATIVE RAG PLATFORM

<br>

**THE CHALLENGE:** Turn a working prototype into something that survives real users, real load, and real production conditions.

**WHAT I BUILT:**
- FastAPI backend with authenticated REST endpoints for conversational AI
- Gemini 2.5 Flash integration with structured reasoning pipelines
- System prompts constrained for domain-specific responses (cloud architecture, finance)
- React frontend deployed as K8s-managed service
- MySQL with persistent volumes - data survives pod restarts
- Traefik ingress exposing the whole thing securely to the internet

**BATTLE SCARS (PROBLEMS I SOLVED):**
- Container image pull auth failures
- K8s DNS and service resolution nightmares
- Environment variable injection mismatches
- Database connectivity edge cases under concurrent load

**RESULT:** Multi-user deployment validated live. Zero crashes. Zero data loss.

### AAPL STOCK ANALYSIS - My First Project

> *Where it all started - predicting Apple stock with ML before I knew what Kubernetes was.*

![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/SCIKIT_LEARN-F7931E?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikitlearn&logoColor=white)
![Finance](https://img.shields.io/badge/FINANCE-2E8B57?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)

A comprehensive financial analysis project combining technical indicators, risk metrics, Monte Carlo simulation, and deep learning to analyze and predict Apple stock behavior using five years of historical data.

<details>
<summary><b>SEE WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD</b></summary>

<br>

**THE GOAL:** Build a complete stock analysis pipeline - from data collection to ML predictions - learning the fundamentals of data science and machine learning.

**TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:**
- RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and moving averages for trend identification
- Rule-based trading signal system combining momentum indicators
- Risk metrics: Value at Risk (VaR), Sortino Ratio, maximum drawdown

**ML PIPELINE:**
- Bidirectional LSTM neural network for sequence pattern recognition
- Random Forest ensemble model as baseline comparison
- Monte Carlo simulation generating 1,000 probabilistic price scenarios

**WHAT I LEARNED:**
- Financial data preprocessing and feature engineering
- The gap between backtesting accuracy and real-world performance
- Why everyone's first ML project involves stock prediction (and why it's humbling)

**STACK:** Python | TensorFlow/Keras | scikit-learn | pandas | yfinance | matplotlib

## CURRENTLY

- **Open to work** - yes, this is my way of saying *please hire me*
- Mass applying to jobs like my Kafka producer pushes messages - high throughput, hoping for at least one successful delivery
- Still obsessing over the gap between "it works on my machine" and "it works in production"
- Available immediately. Will deploy AI systems for coffee. Or money. Preferably both.

## LET'S CONNECT

I'm always down to talk about cloud architecture, AI systems that actually ship, why Kubernetes is simultaneously the best and worst thing ever - or **job opportunities** (seriously, my inbox is ready).
